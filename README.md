# Docker-Series

Welcome to the Docker-Series! ðŸš€

This repo provides Docker setups for popular programming languages. Whether you're a developer or a DevOps engineer, youâ€™ll find Dockerfiles here to easily containerize your apps.

## Whatâ€™s Inside?

### Dockerfiles

These are like recipes for creating Docker images. Each Dockerfile is tailored for a specific programming language. Hereâ€™s what you can find:

- **Python**: For Python apps. Sets up Python and dependencies.
- **Node.js**: For Node.js apps. Uses npm or Yarn for packages.
- **Java**: For Java apps. Handles JAR files.
- **Ruby**: For Ruby apps. Manages dependencies with Bundler.
- **Go**: For Go apps. Builds your Go binaries.
- **PHP**: For PHP apps. Uses Apache to serve your code.
- **C# (.NET Core)**: For .NET Core apps. Handles both build and runtime.
- **React**: For React apps. Builds with Yarn and serves with Nginx.
- **Rust**: For Rust apps. Uses multi-stage builds for efficiency.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repo**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abisecops/Docker-Series.git && cd Docker-Series
   ```

2. **Go to the Directory for Your Language**:

   Each language has its own folder with the Dockerfile and Docker Compose file. Navigate to the one you need.

3. **Build the Docker Image:**
   You can build the Docker image with:
   
      ```bash
      docker build -t your-image-name .
      ```

   This command builds the Docker image and starts the container. 

5. **Run the Container:**

   Start your container with:
   ```
   docker run -p 8080:8080 your-image-name
   ```

6. **Stop and Remove Container**:

   When you're done, stop and remove everything with:
- Stop
   ```bash
   docker stop container-id
   ```
- Remove
  ```
  docker rm container-id
  ```
